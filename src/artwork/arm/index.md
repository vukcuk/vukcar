Vuk Ćuk’s current work examines the era of post-pandemic anxiety, which extends to predictions and speculations on the ongoing economic crisis. This subject has been central to Vuk Ćuk’s practice since the beginning of 2020, when he started observing the global fascination with technological advancements that follow capitalist trends. Following the circulation of data, objects, values, money, viruses and opinions, the artist invites us to re-evaluate how and where our attention spans.
The new series of paintings will remind us of some of the bizarre consequences of human activity, as well as the ways in which “nature retaliates”, as the media often likes to remind us. The dreadful idea of nature that is vindictive and unforgiving threads through the narrative behind these works, reminding us, however, that this view is inherently selfish and essentially human. With that in mind, Ćuk creates an environment in which one cannot be sure whether the hybrid entities on display are referring to something “man-made”, something unnatural, or in fact very natural — belonging to a world of simultaneous hyper-production and emptiness. The booth is a combination of wallpaper, paintings, diamond paintings, and collage. ed

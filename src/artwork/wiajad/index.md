The work of the young Serbian artist Vuk Ćuk explores the position of the individual in contemporary society, in particular in its relationship with the new behaviors of today’s way of life and with the changes caused by phenomena such as technological advancement, globalization, consumerism and climate change. Using a free approach to the various media of sculpture, both static and moving, of installation, drawing, digital art and painting, Ćuk elaborates reflections on the interaction of humans with technology, on the new aesthetic canons that derive from it, and on the freedom of artistic creation, viewed as a territory of possible utopias and alternative visions of the world.

In his latest production, Ćuk’s research has been focusing on the collection and identification of materials from the world of mass consumerism, starting from artificial plants and flowers and going through different types of trinkets: mini-robots, plastic toys, artificial hair, lighting, holographic or computerized devices. Objects and mechanisms that the artist takes apart and reassembles into mesmerizing structures, thus himself becoming the deus ex machina of an irregular set of alienating, isolated and omnivorous ecosystems. An overturned anthropomorphism inhabits the artist’s installations, a symptom of an unhealthy contemporaneity forced to confront its own remains.

Ćuk’s works are often set up as micro-worlds, ecosystems inhabited by small robots made with found objects that move within closed and isolated spaces. The sensory and physical involvement of the visitors plays a central role in the artist’s practice, which aims at stimulating an active role and an openness of mind of the viewer towards new perceptions and interactions with art.
